# Getting Started with the Covalent API

## Introduction

Covalent provides a unified API to bring full transparency and visibility to assets across all blockchain networks. Simply put, Covalent offers a single API that allows you to pull detailed, granular blockchain transaction data from multiple blockchains with no code. The unified Covalent API allows you to create entirely new applications or augment existing ones without configuring or maintaining infrastructure. Covalent supports Moonbase Alpha and plans to support Moonbeam and Moonriver.

## Checking Prerequisites

All requests require authentication; you will need [a free API Key](https://www.covalenthq.com/platform/#/auth/register/) to use the Covalent API. 
Also, you will need the following:

 - Have MetaMask installed and [connected to Moonbase](/getting-started/moonbase/metamask/)
 - Have an account with funds, which you can get from [Mission Control](/getting-started/moonbase/faucet/)

## Types of Endpoints

The Covalent API has two classes of endpoints:

 - **Class A** — endpoints that return enriched blockchain data applicable to all blockchain networks, eg: balances, transactions, log events, etc
 - **Class B** — endpoints that are for a specific protocol on a blockchain, e.g. Uniswap is Ethereum-only and is not applicable to other blockchain networks

## Fundamentals of the Covalent API
 - The Covalent API is RESTful and it is designed around the main resources that are available through the web interface
 - The current version of the API is version 1 
 - The default return format for all endpoints is JSON 
 - All requests require authentication; you will need [a free API Key](https://www.covalenthq.com/platform/#/auth/register/) to use the Covalent API
 - The root URL of the API is https://api.covalenthq.com/v1/ 
 - All requests are done over HTTPS (calls over plain HTTP will fail)
 - The refresh rate of the APIs is real-time: 30s or 2 blocks, and batch 10m or 40 blocks  

## Supported Endpoints
 - **Balances** — Get token balances for an address. Returns a list of all ERC20 and NFT token balances including ERC721 and ERC1155 along with their current spot prices (if available)
 - **Transactions** — Retrieves all transactions for an address including decoded log events. Does a deep-crawl of the blockchain to 
 retrieve all transactions that reference this address
 - **Transfers** — Get ERC20 token transfers for an address along with historical token prices (if available)
 - **Token Holders** — Return a paginated list of token holders
 - **Log Events (Smart Contract)** — Return a paginated list of decoded log events emitted by a particular smart contract
 - **Log Events (Topic Hash)** — Return a paginated list of decoded log events with one or more topic hashes separated by a comma


### Request Formatting
   | Endpoint |     | Format |
   | :---------- | :-: | :------------------- |
   |      Balances       |     |          api.covalenthq.com/v1/1287/address/{address}/balances_v2/          |
   |      Transactions       |     |           api.covalenthq.com/v1/1287/address/{address}/transactions_v2/|
   |      Transfers       |     |           api.covalenthq.com/v1/1287/address/{address}/transfers_v2/           |
   |      Token Holders       |     |           api.covalenthq.com/v1/1287/tokens/{contract_address}/token_holders/           |
   |      Log Events (Smart Contract)       |     |           api.covalenthq.com/v1/1287/events/address/{contract_address}/           |
   |      Log Events (Topic Hash)      |     |           api.covalenthq.com/v1/1287/events/topics/{topic}/           |

## Try it Out
First, make sure you have [your API Key](https://www.covalenthq.com/platform/#/auth/register/) which begins with “ckey_”. The Token Holders Endpoint returns a list of all the token holders of a particular token. For this API call, you’re going to need the following: 

 - Your API Key
 - Moonbase Alpha Chain ID: 1287
 - Contract Address (ERTH Token in this example): 0x08B40414525687731C23F430CEBb424b332b3d35

### Using Curl
Try running the command below in a terminal window after replacing the placeholder with your API key.

```
curl https://api.covalenthq.com/v1/1287/tokens/\
0x08B40414525687731C23F430CEBb424b332b3d35/token_holders/ \
-u {YOUR API KEY HERE}:
```
!!! note
    The colon `:` after the API key is important because otherwise you will be prompted for a password (which is not needed).


The Covalent API will return a list of token holders for the ERTH token. Unless you already owned some ERTH tokens, your address will be missing from that list. Head over to the [Moonbase Alpha ERC-20 Faucet](https://moonbase-minterc20.netlify.app/) to generate some ERTH tokens for yourself. Now repeat the same Covalent API request as above. The Covalent API updates in real-time, so you should now see your address in the list of token holders for the ERTH token.

## Javascript Examples
Copy and paste the below code block into your preferred environment, or [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/). After setting the API key, set the address constant. Remember our chain ID is `1287` for Moonbase Alpha.

=== "Using Fetch"
    ```js
    // set your API key
	const APIKEY = 'YOUR API KEY HERE';

	function getData() {
    const address = '0xFEC4f9D5B322Aa834056E85946A32c35A3f5aDD8'; //example
    const chainId = '1287'; //Moonbeam Testnet (Moonbase Alpha Chain ID)
    const url = new URL(`https://api.covalenthq.com/v1/${chainId}/address/${address}/balances_v2/`);
    
    url.search = new URLSearchParams({
        key: APIKEY
    })

    // use fetch API to get Covalent data
    fetch(url)
    .then((resp) => resp.json())
    .then(function(data) {
        const result = data.data;
  
        console.log(result)
        return result
        }
	)}

    getData();
    ```

=== "Using Async"
    ```js
    // set your API key
    const APIKEY = 'YOUR API KEY HERE';
	const address = '0xFEC4f9D5B322Aa834056E85946A32c35A3f5aDD8'; //example
	const chainId = '1287'; //Moonbeam Testnet (Moonbase Alpha Chain ID)
	const url = new URL(`https://api.covalenthq.com/v1/${chainId}/address/${address}/balances_v2/`);

    url.search = new URLSearchParams({
        key: APIKEY
    })

    async function getData() {
    	const response = await fetch(url);
    	const result = await response.json();
    	console.log(result)
    	return result;
	}

	getData();

    ```

The output should resemble the below. The balances endpoint returns a list of all ERC20 and NFT token balances including ERC721 and ERC1155 along with their current spot prices (if available).

## Python Example
Covalent doesn’t have an official API wrapper. To query the API directly you will have to use the Python [requests library](https://pypi.org/project/requests/). Install requests into your environment from the command line with `pip install requests`. Then import it and use it in your code. Use the HTTP verbs get methods to return the information from the API. Copy and paste the below code block into your preferred environment and run it. The output should look similiar to the screenshot above, however the formatting may vary depending on your environment.

```python
import requests

def fetch_wallet_balance(address):
	api_url = 'https://api.covalenthq.com'
    endpoint = f'/v1/1287/address/{address}/balances_v2/'
    url = api_url + endpoint
    r = requests.get(url, auth=('YOUR API KEY HERE',''))
    print(r.json())
    return(r.json())

#Example address request
fetch_wallet_balance('0xFEC4f9D5B322Aa834056E85946A32c35A3f5aDD8')

```

!!! note
    The 2nd parameter of `auth` is empty, because there is no password required - your API key is all that's needed.

### Community Built Libraries
Covalent currently has libraries in Python, Node, and Go, which are built and maintained by the community as part of the [Covalent Alchemists Program](https://www.covalenthq.com/ambassador/). The tools have been built by the community to provide value to users of the Covalent API and are [available here](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/tools/community).

!!! note
    Note: These tools are NOT maintained by Covalent and users should do their due diligence in evaluating these tools before using them in their projects.
